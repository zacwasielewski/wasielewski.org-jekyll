I’m Zac Wasielewski, a web developer living in Central New York. I spend my free time skiing, rock climbing, and drinking a variety of beers. This blog is an attempt to document my thoughts on life and all of the above. If you’re interested in rock climbing and the outdoors, check out my climbing blog, [Negative Ape](http://negativeape.com/), and bouldering tick list app, [Boulder Problems](http://boulderproblems.com/).

I’m occasionally available for freelance work, especially Ruby on Rails or JavaScript development, but am happy to take on other interesting work. Check out <a href=“/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/zacwasielewski-resume-2014.pdf”>my resume</a>&nbsp;and <a href=“mailto:zac@wasielewski.org”>contact me</a>&nbsp;if you have a job that fits my skills.
