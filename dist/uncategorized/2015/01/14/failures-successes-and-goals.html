<h2 id="successes">Suc­cesses</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I got mar­ried!</strong> <span class="pull-W">W</span>ed­dings are sur­pris­ingly stress­ful and time-con­sum­ing af­fairs.

I<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ould­n’t trade the ex­pe­ri­ence for any­thing, but also it’s a bit<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f a re­lief to put it be­hind us.</li>
  <li><span class="pull-O">O</span>n the<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>od­ing side<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>f life, <strong>I fell in love<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></strong>. I’ve been dab­bling in it for a<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>hile, but this year I ﬁ­nally started to get<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>om­fort­able<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>ith the lan­guage.</li>
  <li><span class="pull-A">A</span>nd<strong> I ﬁ­nally learned to<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>rite au­to­mated tests.</strong> It’s em­bar­rass­ing to ad­mit, but I<span class="push-o"></span> <span class="pull-o">o</span>nly re­cently be­gan<span class="push-w"></span> <span class="pull-w">w</span>rit­ing tests for my<span class="push-c"></span> <span class="pull-c">c</span>ode. <a href="http://exercism.io/">Ex­er­cism.io</a> in­tro­duced me to the prac­tice, and <a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/">Justin<span class="push-W"></span> <span class="pull-W">W</span>eis­s’s blog</a> took me deeper.  I’ve barely scratched the sur­face, but hav­ing learned the ba­sics, I’m ex­cited to keep learn­ing and im­prov­ing.</li>

  <li><strong><span class="pull-C">C</span>limb reg­u­larly.</strong> I’d like to set a reg­u­lar sched­ule for the spring and sum­mer, so that I’m in shape for the fall boul­der­ing sea­son.
